function T = fkine(S,M,q)
% Write a function `fkine' to calculate the forward kinematics of a robotic arm using the Product of Exponentials Formula. The function takes as input a matrix S containing all the screw axes (each column is a screw axis, with column 1 being the screw axis for the first joint, column 2 being the screw axis for the second joint, and so on), a vector of joint variables q, and an homogeneous transformation matrix M representing the robot pose in its home configuration.
% Note the screw axis should contain omega in the first 3 rows and velocity in rows 4:6. For example S(:,i) = [w;v]
% initialize values
